# Cookie-Consent-Vanilla-Plugin
Small and simple plugin that allows you to put a Cookie Consent banner (from silktide.com) on a Vanilla Forum

It's my first plugin ever, feel free to suggest modifications :)

Usage: 
Simply install the plugin on your forum and choose your own text and template for the banner (light/dark, top/bottom).
